When the program is run, the Lorenz Attractor will be displayed. 

The following keys are useful for the program:
Left arrow key: Turns the animation in the left direction about the y-axis.
Right arrow key: Turn the animation in the right direction about the y-axis.

Up arrow key:Turns the animation in the up direction about the x-axis.
Down arrow key:Turns the animation in the down direction about the x-axis.

'e': zoom into the screen.
'r': zoom out of the screen.

Keys to change the parameters in the Lorenz Attractor equation:
'q': Increases the value of sigma in the Lorenz equation by 1.
'w': Decreases the value of sigma in the Lorenz equation by 1.

'a': Increases the value of beta in the Lorenz equation by 0.1.
's': Decreases the value of beta in the Lorenz equation by 0.1.

'z': Increases the value of rho in the Lorenz equation by 1.
'x': Decreases the value of rho in the Lorenz equation by 1.

'd': It will reset the values for sigma, beta and rho to defaults. The default values are:
sigma: 10
beta: 2.6666
rho: 28
